# Semgrep C++ Rules

This repository contains a collection of Semgrep rules specifically designed for C++. These rules may contain some rules describing my personal preferences, but they are generally applicable to most C++ codebases.

## False Positives

This repository is a work in progress, and as such, there may be false positives in the rules. If you find a false positive, please open an issue or a pull request with a fix.
